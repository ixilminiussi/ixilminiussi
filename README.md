### Franco-American Software Engineering Student

Hi, Iâ€™m Ixil Miniussi,

I am a graduate from the University of Southampton having obtained a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I then applied and entered a PhD which I worked on for the last 6 months. Unfortunately, I recently learned that this path simply isn't for me and I'm now looking for opportunities to embolden my resume in software development before diving in to a Master's or even career in game programming.

for all inquiries e-mail me at ixil@miniussi.net
