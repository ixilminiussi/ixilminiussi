Hi, Iâ€™m Ixil Miniussi,

I am a graduate from the University of Southampton having obtained a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I then applied and entered a PhD which I worked on for the last 6 months. Unfortunately, I recently learned that this path simply isn't for me and I'm now looking for opportunities to embolden my resume in ANYTHING BUT WEBDEV. I'm a jack of all trains although my PhD focused mostly on placement problems onto an FPGA architecture for massively parallel computations. I've also accomplished my first game jam recently and have been working on my own games since then.

for all inquiries e-mail me at ixil@miniussi.net, or idm1u19@soton.ac.uk
