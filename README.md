Hi, Iâ€™m Ixil Miniussi,

I am currently mostly active on my university gitlab account, however, I decided to start migrating most of my
projects onto github as a means to share and catallog my experience as a programmer so far.

I am honestly a jack of all trades, master of none, at this point. I'm using my university time to learn as much as
possible in as many fields as possible (data management, software engineering, machine learning, discrete mathematics,
programming language concepts, embedded systems...). 

My goal is to eventually apply and succeed for a PhD in either computational sciences or sensing networks, to assist 
Research expeditions around the globe.

for all inquiries e-mail me at ixil@miniussi.net, or idm1u19@soton.ac.uk
